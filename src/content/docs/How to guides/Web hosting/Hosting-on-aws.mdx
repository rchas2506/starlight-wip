title: Hosting a virtual server using AWS free tier
description: This guide is based upon the methods I used to get started.
---

AWS offers a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free"> range of free services</a> and trails. We'll take advantage of this to host our own server on an EC2 instance and learn a little along the way. How you choose it use it is your choice, but a webserver is always an easy choice to start with. 
AWS provides 750 EC2 hours per month, and includes a public IPV4 address as part of this.

# AWS EC2 instance

## Creating an EC2 instance

For this guide, we can ignore most network settings as you'll be setup with a default VPC.

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps> 

1. Launch an EC2 instance from the EC2 dashboard.

2. Set your instance name, OS image (We'll use the latest ubuntu for this guide), and leave the instance type as is. 

3. Generate a new key pair - Leave the type as RSA and ensure the key file format matches the SSH client you'll use. For this, we'll stick with .ppk - Save this somewhere safe

4. Choose the create security group option, and allow SSH and HTTP traffic. It'll be ideal to select the "My IP" option when choosing who can SSH onto your instance. 

5. Choose how much storage you want/need and launch your instance.

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">You can allocate the entire free allowance even if you don't require this amount - You can use the extra storage to create a larger swap file.</Aside>



Your instance will begin initializing and go online. I'd suggest reviewing the data available to you and learn the UI a little before progressing. 

## Connecting to your instance

With our existing setup, you'll only need the IP of your instance and the .ppk we downloaded during it's creation.
Within putty, navigate to: Connection -> SSH -> Auth -> Credentials and put the file path for the private key in the top box.
Head back to the session category and fill the Host name destination with the public IPv4 address of your instance and connect to your instance
<Aside>Before connecting, you may find it useful to create this as a saved session for streamlined access in the future. Your private key & IP will need to be added back each time otherwise</Aside>
